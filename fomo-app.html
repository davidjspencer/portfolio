        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>To create an app that combats Fear of Missing Out (FoMO), using insights from interviews with people who present FoMO and also research from behavioural scientists.</p>

        <h3>Interviews</h3>
        <p>I interviewed 3 people to find out about their smartphone habits and asked them about suffering from FoMO in general. At the end of the interview I gave the participants a survey which was based upon the work of Przybyzlski and colleagues (2013). This was to ascertain how the people fit onto the FoMO Scale, established by said researchers. Each interviewee fit into the category of suffering from a medium level if FoMO. My research plan can be <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BqhFUpJ3KJCYWDPhwDC3fTTMMBcoGi8pZlWOGUncTvc/edit?usp=sharing">viewed here</a>.</p>
        <h4><span>Key takeaways from the interviews</span></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>People feel they use their phones/social media too much</li>
          <li>Want to reduce but don’t seem to actually do it (I always have my phone at hand/I try to keep my phone away from me)</li>
          <li>Check their phone first thing in the morning and last thing at night</li>
          <li>Experience FoMO</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Why do the interviewees, and possibly you, check their phones when they wake-up and just before sleeping? The <span class="highlight">alarm clock</span> on your smartphone. It is an external trigger, forcing you to reach for your phone to when you wake-up and just before you sleep.</p>

        <h3>Persona</h3>
        <p>Maria is on her phone a lot throughout the whole day, it is her alarm clock, her newspaper, diary, planner, mailbox and sometimes even her phone. Although having good friends and a healthy social life, Maria is prone to suffer from FoMO.</p>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>I wanted to combat FoMO by looking at the problem through the eyes of behavioural scientists. For definitions and health dangers of FoMO I researched Przybyzlski et al and Elisa Wegmanna et al. Which led me to focus on the subject of habits and controlling habits exemplified by Eric Barker, Shawn Achor, BJ Fogg and Nir Eyal. You can see my full <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PBuUQ7gjNwX8BGDxe8whmgnmK221eOKFXJ-LW_Nl6TE/edit?usp=sharing">notes here</a>.</p>
        <h4><span>Key takeaways</span></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>FoMO starts with sadness and social media makes it worse</li>
          <li>The more a person is inclined to gratitude, the less likely he or she is to be depressed, anxious, lonely, envious, or neurotic</li>
          <li>Gratitude can boost serotonin, you don’t even have to find anything, it’s the searching that counts</li>
          <li>By writing down 3 new things you are grateful for, the brain retains a pattern, scanning for positives not negatives first</li>
          <li>Tiny habits: ‘After I <em>[existing habit]</em>, I will <em>[tiny new behaviour]</em>'</li>
          <li>Once Hooked, external triggers are no longer needed, internal triggers precipitate the desired behaviour</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Problem statement</h3>
        <p>Using the interviews and the research into FoMO and habits, I wanted to try to create an app that makes people more resistant to FoMO without drastically changing their lives.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Maria, who feels sad about missing out on  experiences (FoMO), needs to feel happier without deleting her social media accounts.</span></p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Scenario</h3>
        <p>Once in bed, Maria uses Gr8t-itude to set her alarm and then choose 3 things she is grateful for. The trigger of setting the alarm helps the act of gratitude easily become a habit. The Gr8t-itude alarm reinforces Maria's happiness in the morning by waking her up and making her reflect on what she is grateful for.</p>
        <p>By practising gratitude, Maria will be thankful and happy with what she has achieved and experienced, making her immune to FoMO and increasing her general happiness.</p>
        <!-- <p>To break one of the triggers observed in the participants, the alarm clock, Gr8-itude also functions as an alarm to increase Maria's gratitude when setting her alarm and reinforcing this act when turning her alarm off in the morning.</p> -->

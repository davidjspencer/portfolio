        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>To create an app that combats Fear of Missing Out (FoMO), using insights from interviews with people who present FoMO and also research from behavioural scientists.</p>

        <h3>Interviews</h3>
        <p>I interviewed 3 people to find out about their smartphone habits and asked them about suffering from FoMO in general. At the end of the interview I gave the participants a survey which was based upon the work of Przybyzlski and colleagues (2013). This was to ascertain how the participants fit onto the FoMO Scale, which was already established by said researchers. Each participant fit into the category of suffering from a medium level if FoMO. My research plan can be <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BqhFUpJ3KJCYWDPhwDC3fTTMMBcoGi8pZlWOGUncTvc/edit?usp=sharing">viewed here</a>.</p>
        <h4><span>Key takeaways from the interviews</span></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>People feel they use their phones/social media too much</li>
          <li>Want to reduce but don’t seem to actually do it (I always have my phone at hand/I try to keep my phone away from me)</li>
          <li>Check their phone first thing in the morning and last thing at night</li>

        <p>Maria is on her phone a lot throughout the whole day, it is her alarm clock, her newspaper, diary, planner, mailbox and sometimes even her phone. Although having good friends and a healthy social life, Maria is prone to suffer from FoMO.</p>

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>I wanted to combat FoMO by looking at the problem through the eyes of behavioural scientists. For definitions and health dangers of FoMO I researched Przybyzlski et al and Elisa Wegmanna et al. Which led me to focus on the subjects; habits and controlling habits exemplified by Eric Barker, Shawn Achor, BJ Fogg and Nir Eyal. You can see my full <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PBuUQ7gjNwX8BGDxe8whmgnmK221eOKFXJ-LW_Nl6TE/edit?usp=sharing">notes here</a>.</p>
        <!-- <h4>Selected notes</h4>
        <p>Elisa Wegmanna et al</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Feeling of being socially isolated, having a higher level of shyness, and having feelings of anxiety in social interactions are positively correlated with spending more time on social media</li>
          <li>Constant access makes it possible to communicate/interact with others at any place and any time and can lead to compulsive checking behaviors and excessive engagement</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><span>Key takeaways</span></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>FoMO starts with sadness and social media makes it worse</li>
          <li>The more a person is inclined to gratitude, the less likely he or she is to be depressed, anxious, lonely, envious, or neurotic</li>
          <li>Gratitude can boost serotonin, you don’t even have to find anything, it’s the searching that counts</li>
          <li>By writing down 3 new things you are grateful for, the brain retains a pattern, scanning for positives not negatives first</li>
          <li>Tiny habits: ‘After I <em>[existing habit]</em>, I will <em>[tiny new behaviour]</em>'</li>
          <li>Once Hooked, external triggers are no longer needed, internal triggers precipitate the desired behaviour</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Problem statement</h3>
        <p>Using the interviews and the research into FoMO and habits, I wanted to try to create an app that makes people more resistant to FoMO without drastically changing their lives.</p>

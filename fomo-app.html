        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>To create an app that combats Fear of Missing Out (FoMO), the app will be designed in response to information from interviews with people who present FoMO and also using research into FoMO done by others.</p>

        <h3>Interviews</h3>
        <p>I interviewed 3 people to find out about their smartphone habits and asked them about suffering from FoMO in general. At the end of the interview I gave the participants a survey which was based upon the work of Przybyzlski and colleagues (2013). This was to ascertain how the participants fit onto the FoMO Scale, which was already established by said researchers. Each participant fit into the category of suffering from a medium level if FoMO.</p>
        <h4>Key takeaways from the interviews</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>People feel they use their phones/social media too much</li>
          <li>Want to reduce but donâ€™t seem to actually do it (I always have my phone at hand/I try to keep my phone away from me)</li>
          <li>Check their phone first thing in the morning and last thing at night</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why do the participants, and possibly you, check their phones when they wake-up and just before sleeping? Alarm clock apps. They wake you up, forcing you to reach for your phone and you set them, or make sure they are set, before you sleep.</p>

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>Before and after the interviews I wanted to combat FoMO by looking at the problem through the eyes of behavioural scientists. For definitions and health dangers of FoMO I researched Przybyzlski et al and Elisa Wegmanna et al. Which led me to focus on habits and controlling habits exemplified by Eric Barker, Shawn Achor, BJ Fogg and Nir Eyal. You can see my full notes on <a class="link" href="#">this google doc</a>.</p>
        <h4>Selected notes</h4>
        <p>Elisa Wegmanna et al</p>
        <ul>
          <!-- <li>Feeling of being socially isolated, having a higher level of shyness, and having feelings of anxiety in social interactions are positively correlated with spending more time on social media</li> -->
          <li>Constant access makes it possible to communicate/interact with others at any place and any time and can lead to compulsive checking behaviors and excessive engagement</li>
        </ul>
